# Game rules

- Objective: Be the first player to reach 100 points.

- Players: 2 players can participate. The game can also be played against an AI opponent.

- Equipment: A digital six-sided die and an automated score tracker.

### Gameplay:

- On a player's turn, the player can choose to "Roll" or "Hold".
    - If the player chooses to "Roll", the die rolls and updates the turns current score.
    - If the player chooses to "Hold", the current score is added to their total score, and the turn switches to the next player.

- If the die rolls a 1, the turn ends, and the current score is reset to zero.
- If the die shows any number from 2 to 6, that number is added to the turns current score.

### Finally:

- Winning: The first player to accumulate 100 or more total score wins the game.

- Strategy: Players must decide whether to roll again (risking rolling a 1 and losing the turns current score) or to hold and secure their accumulated points for that turn.
