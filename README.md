# Project # 2 - Pig Dice Game - With Modifications!

## The outer (HTML, CSS) design and general idea of the game is based on a project on Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course: [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

### Requirements Definition for the project:

- User can roll a normal 1-6 dice.
  - Users roll will be added to current points. These points are reset if the user rolls 1, and the turn changes. 

- User can hold a turn and receive current points gathered in the turn, which are then added to total points.

- First player to reach 100 points or over wins the game!

- This project will have a backend using Django, and the option of playing vs CPU. Backend coding language is going to be Python, with the frontend developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Modifications

- Modifications from the original project include the addition of backend and the option of playing vs CPU. Any other modifications will be updated if they are to come during progression of this project.

- All credit regarding the projects idea and outer design goes to Jonas Schmedtmann's and his JS-course - as was mentioned above!
