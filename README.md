### Requirements Definition for the project:

- User can roll a normal 1-6 dice.
  - Users roll will be added to current points. These points are reset if the user rolls 1, and the turn changes. 

- User can hold a turn and receive current points gathered in the turn, which are then added to total points.

- First player to reach 100 points or over wins the game!

- This project will have a backend using Python (Django), with the frontend developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- The game has the option of playing vs CPU or vs a human player (locally).
