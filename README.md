### Introduction

The Pig Dice Game is a classic, turn-based dice game designed for 2 or more players, where the goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. This web-based implementation offers both single-player mode against a CPU opponent and local game mode for human players. Developed with a robust backend using Python (Django) and frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to deliver a smooth and straightforward gaming experience.
